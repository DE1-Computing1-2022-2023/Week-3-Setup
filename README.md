# Setting up Git and Your GitHub Account

This week introduces a second important computing tool - version control. We will use Git and GitHub.

1. If you haven't already, [create an account on GitHub](http://github.com/) using your Imperial email address, or if you already have a GitHub account [add your Imperial email address](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).

2. Set up the git config file on your computer by setting the user name and email address. You can optionally set the other fields, if you want. You will need to only do this once. See the [GitHub tutorial on setting your username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and [setting the email address in git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). You can also refer to pg 11 of Pro Git ebook for more details. To set the same username and email address for all git repos, in the terminal type the following:

```
git config --global user.name "my-user-name"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

3. Set up an ssh-key by following [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Be sure to follow all the steps to generate the key and also [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

4. Log into your GitHub account if you haven't already, then click on the link in Blackboard to the exercises for Week 3. Follow the steps to register for the GitHub Classroom for Computing 1 and be sure to select your name and college username to associate your GitHub Classroom account with your general GitHub account. (The Classroom registration link is intentionally only on Blackboard as a mild security measure.) 
5. Click on the final link in the Week 3 exercises on Blackboard to generate a private copy of the git repository of Python exercises within your GitHub Classroom account. From now on the weekly exercises will always be accessed this way.
